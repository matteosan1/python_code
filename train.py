L=.3    ##The spacing between cars


## you could try making the train engine mass different than the car mass
m=.1 ## mass of engine and cars

## dd is the amount that a car can move before getting a force.  This
## would be a good thing to try changing.

a=1.4  ## is a variable used to change the force a car experiences when a
        ## coupling is stretched
mut=.5  ## this is the coefficient of friction on the engine car

muck=0.09  ## coefficient of kinetic friction on a car
g=9.8   ##this is the gravitaional field - comes into play with fricitonal force
